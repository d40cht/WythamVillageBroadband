title: An update from Better Broadband for Oxfordshire
---

The situation in Wytham is as you suggest, in that it was not included in the Better Broadband for Oxfordshire programme as a commercial provider responded to our original Open Market Review in 2012 to state that the village was covered by commercial plans to provide fibre-based broadband. Due to State Aid rules, Oxfordshire County Council cannot apply public funds to area where a commercial provider operates or has plans to in the near future.

However, we have recently been working with the district councils in the county to secure additional funding. We have been successful in match-funding this investment in the South, Cherwell and Vale of White Horse districts with additional investment from BDUK.  Part of this process was to undertake a new Open Market Review; a commercial provider responded to the postcodes in Wytham to say that the village no longer falls within commercial provision, and we are provisionally able to include the village in the area to be considered by BT for additional coverage. The process to incorporate this additional coverage requires that BT models the available investment against what coverage can be achieved and an implementation plan.  This is underway and we expect to have the results of this by December of this year at the latest, at which point we will be able to confirm whether or not Wytham is included in Better Broadband for Oxfordshire. Should this happen, it is likely that fibre broadband service would be available at some time in 2016.

Should Wytham not fall within the plan, there are other options. These include:

* Community-driven initiatives, whereby local communities raising funds might be eligible for a match-fund from the district council to install a privately funded solution.  (Please note this approach is subject to approval by Cherwell DC, and issues such as procurement, and state aid eligibility require further investigation).  In many cases, where BT is extending the fibre network as part of the Better Broadband programme, there may be lower costs in the future than currently, due to the proximity to fibre provided by the existing programme deployment.
* Other network providers operating within the county may be approached to explore a privately-funded solution.
* Our current contract with BT has two ‘clawback’ mechanisms. Both efficient delivery of the programme and good take-up of deployed services are able to generate additional funds to be reinvested into the programme to extend coverage.
* Oxfordshire County Council will continue to appraise new developments and technologies, for example monitoring mobile providers’ plans for deployment of 4G in the county over the next two years.

We are meeting with Gigaclear regularly in an effort to ensure maximum coverage for the county by all suppliers.  You are also welcome to contact them directly to encourage them to extend their footprint from their existing network to cover Wytham.  We will have more information once the supplier confirms in late October/early November where the additional funding will cover.
