title: September 2016, Openreach build update.

__Light at the end of the tunnel (trunking?).__

*Dave King cornered a senior OpenReach engineer in the village a couple of days back. This is what
he found out:*

There were 4 BT OpenReach vans in and out of the village today. I have just manged to have a chat
with one of their guys – he was the head guy and knew every detail about the contract. He told me,
in great technical detail, all of the work that has to be done.


Here is a quick summary of what I understood:
 

1. They are now prepping all of the cables in the cabinet in Wytham: they are making Wytham a
mini-exchange, in effect and making new connections for all of the existing copper wires. This will
involve them snipping the old connections and re-connecting to the new – this will create a
down-time of only a couple of minutes. This will then give us the same service we are on now, but
connected ready for the fibre.
2. They then need to do the work we have heard about under the road at Botley. All the paperwork is
now in with the Authorities to give them permission to dig up the road, etc. They expect to get
clearance in about 5 – 9 days and then it will take a few nights (working between 22:00 and 04:00)
to do all the work necessary. Apparently the underground space is extremely clogged with debris
and they are having to get cleaning equipment in to clean it all out before they can work on it.
3. Finally, it sounded to me as though they are laying a new cable from Oxford to the Botley
cabinet / underground “cabinet”. I think this is because the Botley cabinet is now fully up to
capacity and they need a new line brought in. There is another added complication in that British
Gas recently severely damaged their main trunking coming out of Oxford. They can’t get in to repair
it and, therefore, our new cable can’t go through it. This has been causing a delay. However, their
routing / trunking guys have now found another route and they now have the plans to get the cable
in.

So, the big question is when do we go live? I asked him. He ummmed and arrrhed. I said 3 months and
he replied “No! No! Not that long”. However, he wouldn’t give me any answer! 

I suppose the upshot is the work is underway, there is quite a lot to do but light is showing,
vaguely at the end of the tunnel (or do I mean trunking….?).
