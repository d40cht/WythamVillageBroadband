title: Gigaclear clarifies their position.
---

**_Great news_**: Gigaclear have conditionally commited to bringing their service to the village.

* *If* the university contracts them to install broadband to the woods office, *and*
* *If* we have 50% of the main village committed to taking their service (just over 20 households)

then they will commit to installing their broadband service. **Which is excellent news**.

On this [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zGEqJUtdo16I.k9vaO01RXGBs), the area
marked 'Core Wytham houses' is the area they have committed to cover. Coverage for FAI and
associated properties and the Mill would require additional discussions because of their distance
from the main part of the village.

* In addition to getting engagement from Gigaclear, we will then need to get permission from the
university (for the properties under their tenancy) to install an additional cable into each house.
