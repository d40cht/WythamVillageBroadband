title: July 2015, BT will provide Broadband.
---

__The good news__

The university have put in an order to BT to upgrade the village broadband infrastructure. We
should be getting a Fiber cabinet in the village, and broadband speeds are likely to increase by
a factor of at least 10x for most people. Hurray!

__The bad news__

Despite taking a substantial amount of money upfront for the order, BT are not prepared to commit
to delivering the upgrade until *February 2016*. We will be trying our best to get this date moved
forward and the upgrade delivered sooner.
