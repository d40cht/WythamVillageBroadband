title: March 2016, Fiber Cabinet!
---

The 21st Century has landed.

Those of you who've recently entered or left the village via the A34 or Botley may have noticed
this unassuming green box appearing on the left hand side on the way into the village.

This is our new BT Fiber Cabinet, and is tangible evidence that real broadband will be arriving
soon (many thanks to Sean for seeing this through and coordinating the final push with the various
contractors). Although the box is in place, BT have yet to wire it up: via Fiber-optic to the
cabinet in Botley, and then to connect each up each of our houses. I hear that this could yet take
between 1 and 3 months (mainly in waiting for BT to have staff available - the actual work should
be a few days). However: it will definitely be happening! I'll keep you posted as I know more.

The contractors I spoke to estimated that (within the main part of the village) we should be able
to expect speeds of between 70 and 50 Mbs. I gather that most people currently get between
1 and 2 Mbs, so this should be well worth the wait...
