The monthly cost of the Gigaclear service is higher than the cost of our present service at first
glance, but it unlocks to the door to services that require fast broadband, one of which is
internet telephony, or Voice over IP.

## What is VOIP?

Voice over Internet is the telephony system used by many commercial organisations and is becoming
increasingly popular in the domestic environment – principally, with faster Broadband. It uses the
Internet to make and receive calls, rather than the telephony backbone owned by BT.

## How will it save me money?

If we end up with Gigaclear as a provider, we’ll already be paying the monthly fee for broadband.
All we need to use VOIP is an appropriate provider. In a similar way that BT offer telephony
services to your home, there are many providers who offer VOIP services to broadband users.

BT not only charges you for the calls you make, but they also charge you line rental, which is
generally around £14.60 per month. This is still true even if you use a different provider for
telephony, such as TalkTalk or Sky – they still use BT’s network and line rental is payable.
VOIP providers don’t charge line rental – just a small monthly fee that allows you to make anything
from 1000 minutes to unlimited calls to UK landlines per month.

A company called Vonage charge just £5.99 a month for the unlimited UK call service. Plus, calls to
mobiles and other countries are considerably cheaper than BT and other providers.

## So I can stop using BT and save money?

Yes! As the Gigaclear service uses a custom built fibre optic network, it doesn’t use BT’s existing
cabling, so your Internet and VOIP service come without the cost of line rental from BT. You could
of course still keep your BT service, as their cabling and Gigaclear’s will run in parallel, but
when you could get calls for so much less per month, why would you?

Have a look at your last BT (or other provider) bill and see what you’re really paying. Add to it
the cost of your current, slow broadband to get the total monthly cost. Gigaclear and Vonage VOIP
would be £42.99 a month – is it really that much more than you’re paying now for a sub-standard
broadband service?

## Are there any disadvantages?

The only disadvantage to a VOIP phone is that you rely on the internet service and power
(electricity) being available to make calls. It is extremely rare for BT's phone service to go down
and it will normally keep running even during a power cut. Whereas a VOIP phone is dependent upon
both your internet connection and your electrical power.

However a mobile phone can provide adequate backup in most circumstances, so many people may not
be bothered by this limitation.

## Will I need a new telephone?

VOIP requires your telephone to be plugged into your broadband router rather than the
usual telephone socket. This means your current telephone won’t work on its own. However, for
around £25 you can buy a VOIP adapter that allows you to plug your existing phone
into it. The adapter them plugs into the router and you’re ready to go.

Alternatively you can buy a new VOIP telephone, which will plug directly into the router. These
start at around £20 depending on the number of features.

## Do I need to use my computer to make calls?

There is a common belief that making VOIP calls requires a computer connected to the
Internet. It’s true if you want to make a video call using a service like Skype, but for normal
voice calls you’d use your telephone as you have done in the past. The only difference is that the
phone is connected to your broadband router rather than the traditional BT wall socket.

## Can I keep my telephone number?

In most cases the answer is yes. If you use BT you can release your number and attach it to your
VOIP service. If you use TalkTalk it can still be done, but the process is a little more
complicated.

## Can people still call me if I use VOIP?

Other people or businesses that call you don’t need to use VOIP themselves – your number will still
work just like before no matter how they get their telephony.

## Can I call people that don’t use VOIP?

Yes. Your VOIP service works just like your old one, so you can call any number anywhere in the
world, whether they use VOIP, mobile or landline.

## Do I still get call services like caller ID, 1471 and call waiting?

Yes. As we’ve used Vonage in our examples above, [here](http://www.vonage.co.uk/inclusive-call-features)
