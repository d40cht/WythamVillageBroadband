## Our existing broadband provision

At present, the only broadband provider in the village is BT. Because of the distance to the
exchange(s) and the age of the copper wires involved, the speeds we can obtain are very slow
by modern standards. Many households are unable to watch a single low-definition BBC iPlayer stream,
and those who work from home or run businesses from home are significantly disadvantaged by the low
connection speeds.

## What can we do?

There are several possible options for improving broadband provision in Wytham, all of which are
hampered by the small size of the village. For a commercial provider, there may simply not be
enough subscribers for it to be worth their while to upgrade our network. Subsidies exist for our
county (via [Better broadband for Oxfordshire](http://www.betterbroadbandoxfordshire.org.uk/home))
but the council are prioritising the larger villages.

Regardless of provider, in order to stand a chance of getting an upgrade, we need to show that
there is significant interest in improving the service, and that a high proportion of households
would intend to sign up if the option was available.

The two main contenders for upgrading the village infrastructure are BT (via the rural broadband
initiative) and [Gigaclear](http://www.gigaclear.com/). The monthly cost of high-speed broadband
provision including line rental is between 30 and 40 pounds per month.

*If you are keen to see an improved broadband service in the village, and want to do your bit,
please fill in the form [here](registerinterest) to register your interest. The more people we
have signed up, the likelier it is that a service can be provided - so your vote really does count.*
