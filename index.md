title: Broadband for Wytham Village

## Our existing broadband provision

At present, the only broadband provider in the village is BT. Because of the distance to the
exchange(s) and the age of the copper wires involved, the speeds we can obtain are very slow
by modern standards. Many households are unable to watch a single low-definition BBC iPlayer stream,
and those who work from home or run businesses from home are significantly disadvantaged by the low
connection speeds.

## What is coming?

Mid 2015, the university committed to improving Wytham's broadband provision, and after evaluating
two providers (Gigaclear and BT) decided upon BT. The primary funding for the upgrade will come
from the university, but the village has also raised money for the upgrade. An order was placed
with BT in March 2015.

## Some progress

Having placed the order (and paid a significant proportion of the money upfront), BT were only
prepared to say that the order would be complete around February 2016 (almost a year after the order
date). It is now mid-July 2016 and although there has been some visible progress (since March 2016
we have a green Fiber cabinet installed on the Botley entrance to the village) the work has not
been completed. *More importantly, there is total radio silence from BT about progress so we have no
idea when to expect the rest of the work to complete.*

## What's left to do?

The remaining work required is for BT to wire our houses to the new cabinet, and wire the cabinet
to an exchange or cabinet in Oxford. BT have given no indication of when this is going to happen.
Having cornered a couple of Openreach engineers a few weeks back, it appears that the actual work
to do this will not take long (a few days). So the holdup is scheduling: BT need to decide to do
the work!

## BT Timeline of shame

__Date__ | __Progress__
March 2015 | The university chooses BT over Gigaclear and an order is placed (with substantial downpayment).
April 2015 | BT lets us know that the install won't happen until *February 2016*(!)
February 2016 | No news from BT, no broadband.
March 2016 | A green Fiber cabinet is installed in the village, hopes are raised.
July 2016 | No further progress on broadband, *radio silence from BT*.

## What can I do to help, right now?

If you are keen to see an improved broadband service in the village, and want to do your bit,
please __phone BT customer services__ to ask about the status of the upgrade. Most likely they will
be unwilling to share any information, but if enough people call, we may get a reply or they may
consider reprioritising the work.
