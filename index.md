title: Broadband for Wytham Village

## Our existing broadband provision

At present, the only broadband provider in the village is BT. Because of the distance to the
exchange(s) and the age of the copper wires involved, the speeds we can obtain are very slow
by modern standards. Many households are unable to watch a single low-definition BBC iPlayer stream,
and those who work from home or run businesses from home are significantly disadvantaged by the low
connection speeds.

## What is coming?

Mid 2015, the university committed to improving Wytham's broadband provision, and after evaluating
two providers (Gigaclear and BT) decided upon BT. The primary funding for the upgrade will come
from the university, but the village has also raised money for the upgrade. An order was placed
with BT.

## Some progress

Having placed the order (and paid a significant proportion of the money upfront), BT were only
prepared to say that the order would be complete around March 2016 (9 months from the order date).
It is now mid-July 2016 and although there has been some visible progress (since March 2016 we
have a green Fiber cabinet installed on the Botley entrance to the village) the work has not been
completed.

## What's left to do?

The remaining work required is for BT to wire our houses to the new cabinet, and wire the cabinet
to an exchange or cabinet in Oxford. BT have given no indication of when this is going to happen.

## Timeline of shame

*Date* | *Progress*
__March 2015__ | The university chooses BT over Gigaclear and an order is placed (with substantial downpayment).
__April 2015__ | BT lets us know that the install won't happen until February 2016.
__February 2016__ | No news from BT, no broadband.
__March 2016__ | A green Fiber cabinet is installed in the village, hopes are raised.
__July 2016__ | No further progress on broadband, radio silence from BT.

## What can I do to help, right now?

If you are keen to see an improved broadband service in the village, and want to do your bit,
please __phone BT__ to ask about the status of the upgrade. Most likely they will be unwilling to
share any information, but if enough people call, we may get a reply or they may consider
reprioritising the work.
