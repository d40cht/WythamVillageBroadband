## Current broadband provision

At present, the only broadband provider in the village is BT. Wytham is served by two exchanges:
one side of the village via Botley to the exchange in the center of Oxford, the other side of the
village to the exchange in Summertown.

In both cases the connections are via long stretches of copper wire in poor conditions. As a result
most of us are close to the maximum speed we can expect. For a good connection, you can expect 3Mbs
and probably be able to reliably stream low-definition video from iPlayer (although you will then
not be able to do any other significant internet access). For a poor connection you may only be
getting 1Mbs and may yet have never experienced video streaming online.

Recently the a BT infinity green cabinet was installed in Botley. A couple of villagers have had
their phone lines transferred from the Oxford exchange to the Botley cabinet (having also agreed to
pay for BT infinity) and have seen increases in connection speed, although by no more than a factor
of two. Whilst this may be worthwhile, the speeds realized are nothing like those promised for
Infinity (about 1/10th of the speed).

If BT are to provide a good broadband service in Wytham they will need to bring a fiber-optic cable
to Wytham and install a cabinet within the village. There is money available to improve broadband
provision in rural areas, but generally areas with higher populations are being prioritised. With
just over 50 houses, Wytham is very low down on the list and we may not be upgraded for years.

## Is there anything I can do right now?

### Improving the quality of the line in your house

If you are in one of the houses where broadband speeds are less than 3Mbs and you have more than
one phone point in the house (e.g. one upstairs and one downstairs), you may be able to get higher
speeds by unplugging the additional phone points.

### Getting your line connected to the Botley cabinet

We are currently investigating whether this is something we can all apply for.
