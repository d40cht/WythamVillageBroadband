Various subsidies exist for the purposes of installing rural broadband. We have not yet
exhaustively explored all possibilities. If you become aware of any that seem relevant, then
please add them to the comments section below - and we can explore them further.


## SuperConnected cities

There are grants available for small businesses to get better broadband (up to Â£3000 per applicant). 
However at the moment Wytham is not included in the Oxford scheme. We are investigating with the
council whether they are prepared to extend the boundaries so we can be included.

Stay posted for more details. In the meantime, for information about the scheme, click
