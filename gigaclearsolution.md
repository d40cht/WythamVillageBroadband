## Gigaclear's solution

[Gigaclear](www.gigaclear.com) provides broadband to the property over their own network and
specialise in providing internet for rural locations that the main providers (BT/Virgin) do not
consider to be commercially viable.

Because they do not use the BT phone lines, and install their own network, they do not use copper
cable but install fiber-optic cable directly to each property. This enables speeds of *1000Mbs*
making them one of the fastest broadband providers anywhere in the world (and a full 10x faster
than BT infinity).

## Can we get it?

Until recently, Gigaclear has considered Wytham to be too small to be commercially viable. However
they have now completed an installation of their network in Farmoor, just over the hill from here.
Moreover the woods office are looking to improve their broadband connection for their own use, and
for that of researchers, and Gigaclear are one of the solutions under consideration. Should they be
chosen it would reduce the cost of installation for Gigaclear for the rest of the village as the
fiber-optic cable would only have to come down the hill rather than all the way from Farmoor.

In order to convince Gigaclear to even consider us, even should the woods office get a connection, we
would need *at least half the village*, probably a minimum of 25 households to commit to taking the
service.

## Who can I talk to to find out more?

Alex Wilson, recently returned to the village from Appleton to #12 Wytham has had the Gigaclear
service for the last two years, is a huge fan, and would be very to answer questions.
