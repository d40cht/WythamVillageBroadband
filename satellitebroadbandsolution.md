Satellite broadband is available in all locations with a clear view of the sky. A small satellite
dish is mounted to the side of a property (similar to that used for satellite TV) and the broadband
connection travels over this. Data rates of up to *20Mbs* are achievable (about 1/4 of the speed
of BT Infinity and 1/50th of Gigaclear) but the service is relatively expensive (in terms of
hardware and connection costs) and subject to quite strict usage caps.

Moreover the data can take half a second or more to travel from a household to the internet. Whilst
this doesn't matter when browsing the web, this delay is sufficiently long to make video calls (via
Skye or a different provider) too delayed to feel natural.
